# SwingTradeUltra

SwingTradeUltra is a personal project that aims to accurately determine if a certain stock is a good swing trade opportunity, with the goal for at least 2:1 profit ratio with 60% accuracy.

The indicators I'm using have been back-tested and applied through live stock trading, my trading stats can be shared through a Robinhood CSV file. It utilizes the CCI indicator as well as the VIX_FIX indicator.

NOTE: The current version is in Beta and has incomplete features, do not fully rely on it at the moment.

Future additions:
*Better integration with VIX_FIX formula
*More thorough analysis
*Advanced web GUI
*Automatic e-mail alerts for buy and sell opportunities for stocks on watchlist
*Will be able to determine what stocks have weak trends (month, quarter, year) that increase risk
*Will be able to give an index for risk to reward
