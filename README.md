# SwingTradeUltra

SwingTradeUltra is a project that aims to be able to determine is a certain stock is a good swing trade opportunity.

The indicators I'm using have been back-tested and applied through actual stock trading, my trading stats can be shared through a Robinhood CSV file. It utilizes the CCI indicator as well as the VIX_FIX indicator.

NOTE: The current version is in Beta and has incomplete features, do not fully rely on it at the moment.

Future additions:
*Better intergration with VIX_FIX formula
*You can let the program know if you're looking to enter or exit a trade for a specific stock
*Will be able to determine what stocks have weak trends (month, quarter, year) that increase risk
*Will be able to give an index for risk to reward
*More advanced GUI
